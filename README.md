A to-do Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Running on Web

Make sure you run the example app on port 5000, since `localhost:5000` is
whitelisted for Google authentication. To do so, run:

```
flutter run -d web-server --web-port 5000
```
